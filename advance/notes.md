## oops

## javascript is a prototype based Object-oriented language which means classes are not used but constructor funcion is used.

## Object

- collection of properties and methods
- eg - toLowerCase

## parts of object

- object literal {}
- classes
- constructor function
- prototype => behaviour of js jiske through new , this , inheritance hora h
- instances (this , new)

# 4 pillars

- abstraction (details hide)
- encapsulation (for data security)
- inheritance ()
- polymorphism ( many forms to perform an action)

## advance array

There are two types of arrays: holey arrays and continuous arrays. These arrays can contain three
types of elements: SMI (Small Integer), Packed Element, and Double.

1. **Holey Array**: A holey array is an array that contains missing or empty elements. For example,
   [1, 2, , 4] is a holey array because it has a missing element. Holey arrays are less optimized
   for performance.

2. **Continuous Array**: A continuous array is an array that does not contain missing or empty
   elements. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] is a continuous array because it has no missing elements.
   Continuous arrays are more optimized for performance.

In terms of optimization, continuous arrays are more efficient and optimized for various operations
compared to holey arrays.
